glNetViz is a tool for visualizing computer network topologies with WebGL.

With the abilities of real time visualizing network traffics flowing 
around the local network and to/from the Internet, you can manage the 
various network more easily and efficiently. glNetViz is intended to be 
a convenient tool that can easily visualize the network topology from
